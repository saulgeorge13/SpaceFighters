# Space Fighters
This mini-project is my first run-in with pygame. I've 
coded using python for the last 3 years so its about time I 
gain a better understanding of its pygame module.

This "mini-project" is meant to be a homage to the classic
arcade game Space Invaders. Initially committed on 7/11/2020,
I believe this should not take me too long.

Also as a bonus I won't have to go searching for an emulator
next time I'm in a nostalgic mood.



To Add:
    different colored enemies have different healths??
    random spawns can't overlap
